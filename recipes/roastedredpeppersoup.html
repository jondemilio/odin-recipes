         <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>6 red bell or pointed peppers, (around 6 peppers)</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 sun dried tomatoes, jarred</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and whole</li>
        <li>1 squeeze lemon juice (around 1/2 tbsp)</li>
        <li>2.5 cups vegetable stock, (600ml)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp homemade pesto</li>
        <li>creme fraiche, for topping</li>
        <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 1</strong> </em> Pre-heat the oven to 200°C (400°F).</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 2</strong> </em> Roughly chop the red peppers and place in a large baking tray with peeled whole garlic cloves. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper then roast in the oven until slightly charred (around 40 minutes).</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 3</strong> </em> Finely chop a white (yellow) onion and saute in a large pot with a little olive oil until translucent and soft. Once soft, add the roasted peppers and garlic, sun dried tomatoes and vegetable stock.</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 4</strong> </em> Simmer for 10 minutes then turn off the heat and blend until completely smooth using an immersion blender. Taste for seasoning, I only add pepper because there's enough saltiness from the stock and sun dried tomatoes and pre seasoned peppers.</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 5</strong> </em> Add a small splash of freshly squeezed lemon juice, stir and serve with a drizzle of creme fraiche and homemade pesto. Grab a hunk of crusty bread and dive in.</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 6</strong> </em> Slurp slurp and enjoy!</ol>
        <ol><em><strong>Step 7</strong> </em> Save the left overs, haha jk there will be no left overs.</ol>
